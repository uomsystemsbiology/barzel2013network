### Overview

This is the reference environment for the manuscript ['Network link prediction by global silencing of indirect correlations'](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nbt.2601).  It executes code to reproduce specific results described in the manuscript.   You can find more information about this research at the GitHub repository for the code(https://github.com/baruchbarzel/NatureBiotech-31-720.git).

### Instructions for use

This version of the reference environment is a live image as a bootable read-only ISO.  To use it:

- Install a virtualization tool like [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/), then 
- Create a new virtual machine in the virtualization tool with a virtual CD/DVD-ROM drive
- Mount the ISO in the drive
- Boot the machine.  

This will start a virtual machine with scripts to run which reproduce results described in the manuscript.
