### Instructions for use

This version of the reference environment is a virtual machine managed by [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com).  To use it, install [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/), then do:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/uomsystemsbiology/barzel2013network.git
$ cd barzel2013network
$ vagrant up
```
This will start a virtual machine with scripts to run which reproduce results described in the manuscript.
